Marquand.org is a work in progress. We hope to ultimately be the best Marquand resource on the internet, which means that we're mainly competing with Wikipedia.

In the next months, we hope to compile a comprehensive Marquand bibliography, collect articles about Marquand, and provide some of our own commentary. We also would like to put on a Marquand event in early 2022.

Feel free to send comments and suggestions to the email address listed in the footer. We are very open to any submissions!

It is our decided opinion that the Moto novels are dreck. They will not be mentioned again.
