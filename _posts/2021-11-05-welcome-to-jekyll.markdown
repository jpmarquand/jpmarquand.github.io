Stephen Birmingham, author of *The Late John Marquand*, *Our Crowd*, and many other works, describes his relationship with John Marquand in his posthumous memoir [*A Writer Writes*](https://www.amazon.com/Writer-Writes-Birmingham-Historian-Best-Selling/dp/1493061909).  Marquand took a young Birmingham under his wing and helped launch his literary career through the influence he wielded at Little, Brown.


Beyond Marquand, Birmingham also explores the vicissitudes of a young Stephen Sondheim, his fraternity brother at Williams, his New England childhood, his affair with Ava Gardner, his annoyance with Richard Burton, and some of the stories behind his books. Less interesting are frequent and often lengthy interludes of Carey Birmingham, his son and editor of *A Writer Writes*, though they do in their own way provide a portrait of the underbelly of a glamorous sixties writerly figure.

*A Writer Writers* is currently only sold as an e-book, but will be available in print next spring. Below is a small excerpt of the section on Marquand.

In the Brandt’s' case, there was a slight difference.  John Marquand was probably Carl Brandt's closest friend, and certainly one of his most profitable clients.  Carl Brandt thought highly of Marquand's work, and Marquand valued Brandt's opinion of it - - more so, in fact, than he did that of his editors at Little, Brown.  At the same time, when Carol Brandt told me that Marquand had read my manuscript and invited me to meet him for drinks at her apartment, I knew that Carol and Marquand had been lovers for the better part of fourteen years.  It was an arrangement that suited everybody - - or, rather, everybody except Mrs. Marquand and Marquand's five children, none of whom had been able to quite grasp the elegance of this design for living. . . .
John Marquand had used Carol Brandt as the model for the character of Marvin Myles in H. M. Pulham, Esquire, Harry Fulham' s first and only great love - - a bright, free-spirited young New York career woman, somewhat incongruously played by Hedy Lamarr[*] in the film version.  Marquand was always sparing in his physical descriptions of his fictional characters, preferring to let their words and actions create pictures of them in the minds of his readers.  His description of Marvin Myles is typically lean and terse, and he says of her only that “Her eyes and mouth were both straight and defiant.” That is an apt summation of Carol Brandt.
 
As it happened, on the afternoon that Carol invited me to have drinks with her and John Marquand to discuss my manuscript, I had read none of Marquand's novels.  The only work of his I'd read was a very clever short story called The End Game, based on a game of chess.  Obviously, caught short by this invitation, I had no chance to catch up on my reading of Marquand, and knew I was going to have to wing it when I met him later in the day.
 
When he stepped into the library of the Brandt's apartment that evening, the first thing that struck me about him was that he didn't look like a writer.  I don't know what I expected a famous novelist to look like, but Marquand looked more like a bank vice-president or a Wall Street lawyer.  He was a handsome, compactly built man in his early sixties with carefully combed silver hair and a small, neatly trimmed moustache.  He was dressed in a dark, three-piece suit, white shirt, and conservative necktie.  His manner, as Carol introduced us and we shook hands, struck me at first as reserved and almost courtly.  I'd rehearsed what I was going to say to him, and so, as we sat down, I said, lying, “Of course I've read and enjoyed many of your novels, Mr. Marquand.  But I must say that one of my favorite pieces of yours is a short story called ‘The End Game.’” 
 
All at once he was positively beaming.  “Well!”  he said, slapping his knee.  “Is that so?  You know, I've always been rather proud of that short story.  If I do say so, I think it’s one of the best things I've ever written!”  Once again, I'd managed to be lucky.  From that moment on, John Marquand and I were friends. Nathan, Carol Brandt's elegant black butler, took our orders for drinks.
 
What had happened that weekend, I learned later, and the reason why Marquand had read my manuscript, was this: Marquand had been staying with the Brandt’s, as he usually did when he was in New York, and on Saturday morning Carl Brandt had suddenly felt ill and had been rushed to a hospital with what was feared to be a heart attack.  (It turned out not to be.)  As Carol Brandt and Marquand sat alone in the apartment, waiting for word from the doctors and the hospital, Carol said, “Look, there's no point in the two of us just sitting here worrying about Carl.  Let's get to work.  Here's a manuscript that's just come in - - a first novel by a young writer named Stephen Birmingham.  Let's read it and see what we think.”  They sat there in the Brandt’s' library, passing the pages of my manuscript back and forth between them.
 
After reading about thirty pages, I was later told, Marquand put down the script and said, “I'm sorry, but I'm afraid this really isn't very good.”  “Give it a few more pages,” Carol said.
 
Marquand sighed, and read on. A few minutes later, he said, “Actually, it's beginning to get better.” And he read on, to the end, at which point he said, “It's really rather good.  I'd like to meet the young man.” 
 
And now he was saying to me, “I enjoyed your novel very much, though it gets off to a slow start.  I'd do some heavy cutting in the first thirty or so pages if I were you.  You've got to grab the reader right at the beginning of a book preferably on the first page, even better in the first sentence of the very first paragraph.  If you haven't grabbed the reader by the third or fourth page, he's going to put your book down and never pick it up again.  Also, your writing is overly adverbial.  Remember - - nouns and verbs are the workhorses of the language.  A string of heavy adjectives won't help a weak noun, and adverbs are the weakest words of all.  If I were you, I'd go through this script and delete every word ending in 'ly.'  And you don't need to tell the reader how a particular line of dialogue is spoken, you don't need to say, 'he implored,' or 'she demanded.'  If your dialogue is good enough the tone of voice is implicit.  Just write, 'he said,' or 'she said,' and only when the reader could be confused as to who's saying what.” 
 
He then sprang to his feet and, his glass of whiskey swinging in circles in his hand as he spoke, began to give us a demonstration of what he meant, improvising a scene from an imaginary novel:
 
“’Have you fed the baby?’  she demanded mincingly.
‘Not yet,’ he riposted cagily.
‘Why not?’ she inquired coyly.
‘I thought you were going to do it,’ he countered uncomprehendingly.
‘But it's your turn,’ she expostulated wearily.
‘Are you sure, dearest?’ he threw back at her fiercely.  ‘Of course, I'm sure’ she retaliated winsomely.
‘You’re wrong,’ he ejaculated triumphantly.”
 
It went on for some minutes, and when he sat down at the conclusion of this little act, I decided that if John Marquand had not chosen to be a writer, he could have earned a tidy living as a stand-up comic in Las Vegas.  He was an extremely funny man - - even funnier, somehow, in his bespoke, pin-stripe three-piece suit.
 
He also had some ideas about titles.  I'd titled my manuscript The Year of the Avocado, a title I found (and still do find, a little) poetic and evocative, since the hero of the tale, Jimmy Keefe, is a young man whose wife has left him, who is drifting into alcoholism as well as into an affair with his best friend's wife, while haplessly and fruitlessly (my penchant for adverbs still pops up from time to time) trying to grow an avocado from a seed pierced with toothpicks over a glass of water in his lonely kitchen.
 
“Don’t call it that,” Marquand said.  “You’d be amazed at the number of people who don't know what an avocado is, much less how to pronounce the word. In bookstores, people get shy and reluctant to ask for a book if they're not sure how to pronounce a word in the title.  People like to read books that are about people, so I try to put peoples' names in my titles - - The Late George Apley; H. M. Pulham, Esquire; Sincerely, Willis Wayde; Melville Goodwin; U.S.A.; B.F. 's Daughter.  I still wish I'd given Apley a different name.  Nobody knew how to pronounce it.  People kept coming into stores and asking for The Late George Appleby.  I'd have sold a lot more copies of that book if I'd given Apley a different name.” 

He then returned to the subject of my title.  “Don’t get fancy with titles,” he said.  “Keep them simple.  Your novel is about a young man named Keefe.  Why not call it Young Mr. Keefe?” 

“I will,” I said. . .
